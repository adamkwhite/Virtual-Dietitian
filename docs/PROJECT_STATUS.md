## Open Issues

### Technical Debt (Low Priority)
- [ ] **Issue #7:** Add test coverage for USDA client module (currently excluded from coverage reports)
- [ ] Enable CNF/USDA APIs in production (currently feature-flagged off)

### Experimental Features (On Hold)
- [ ] Image-based food logging (63/72 sub-tasks remaining)
  - Vision API client implementation
  - Food label mapping
  - Serving size inference
  - Image upload UI
  - Testing and deployment

### Phase 3 (Future Enhancements)
- [ ] Multi-turn conversations with context tracking
- [ ] Meal history persistence (database integration)
- [ ] Dietary goal setting and progress monitoring
- [ ] Personalized recommendations based on user patterns
- [ ] Export nutrition reports (PDF, CSV)

## Current Priorities

### ðŸ”´ HIGH PRIORITY
**None** - Phase 2 is complete and stable. No urgent items.

### ðŸŸ¡ MEDIUM PRIORITY

1. **Commit Recent Changes (Main Branch)**
   - 2 uncommitted files: `.claude/settings.local.json`, `docs/demo/virtual-dietitian-demo.html`
   - Decision needed: Commit to main or create feature branch?

2. **Enable API Fallbacks in Production (Optional)**
   - CNF and USDA APIs fully implemented but feature-flagged off
   - Requires API keys in Cloud Function environment
   - Monitor performance and costs after enablement

3. **Image Processing Feature (Experimental - ON HOLD)**
   - Branch: `feature/image-food-logging` (draft PR #20)
   - Progress: 9/72 sub-tasks (infrastructure only)
   - Remaining: 63 sub-tasks (Vision API client, food mapping, upload UI, testing)
   - Decision needed: Continue implementation or defer to Phase 3?

### ðŸŸ¢ LOW PRIORITY (Technical Debt)

1. **Issue #7:** USDA client test coverage (0% â†’ 90%)
   - Low priority - module excluded from coverage reports
   - Only needed if enabling USDA API in production

---

## Next Steps

### For Stakeholders
1. Review live demo at https://storage.googleapis.com/virtual-dietitian-demo/index.html
2. Test the agent with various meal descriptions (English, French, Spanish)
3. Review architecture documentation
4. Decide on Phase 3 roadmap priorities
5. Evaluate image processing feature (continue vs. defer)

### For Development
1. **No high priority items** - Phase 2 complete and stable
2. Consider enabling CNF/USDA APIs in production (feature-flagged)
3. Optional: Continue experimental image processing feature
4. Optional: Address Issue #7 (USDA client test coverage)
5. Monitor SonarCloud quality metrics and user feedback
