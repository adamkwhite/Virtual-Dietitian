## Open Issues

### Technical Debt
- [ ] **Issue #6:** Migrate from deprecated sonarcloud-github-action
- [ ] **Issue #7:** Add test coverage for USDA client module (0% → 100%)

### Phase 2 Completion Items
- [ ] Enhanced error handling and logging
- [ ] Performance optimization (caching)

### Phase 3 (Planned)
- [ ] Multi-turn conversations with context
- [ ] Meal history tracking
- [ ] Dietary goal setting and monitoring
- [ ] Personalized recommendations
- [ ] Export nutrition reports

## Next Steps

### For Stakeholders
1. Review live demo at https://storage.googleapis.com/virtual-dietitian-demo/index.html
2. Test the agent with various meal descriptions
3. Review architecture documentation in docs/demo/architecture.md
4. Discuss Phase 3 roadmap priorities

### For Development
1. Address technical debt (Issues #6, #7)
2. Monitor SonarCloud quality metrics
3. Plan Phase 3 feature priorities
4. Consider user feedback from initial demo
