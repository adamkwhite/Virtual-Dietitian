**Current Status:** Sessions 1-3 completed, Sessions 4-6 remaining

## Completed Work (Sessions 1-3)

### âœ… Session 1: GCP Setup & Environment Configuration
- GCP project configured (virtualdietitian)
- Required APIs enabled
- gcloud CLI configured
- Project structure initialized

### âœ… Session 2: Nutrition Database Creation
- Created `data/nutrition_db.json` with 47 common foods
- Organized across 6 categories (proteins, grains, fruits, vegetables, dairy, fats)
- Full nutritional data including calories, macros, and micronutrients

### âœ… Session 3: Cloud Function Webhook Development
- Implemented `main.py` with Flask request handler
- Created `nutrition_calculator.py` for nutrient aggregation
- Built tiered `rule_engine.py` with 3 rule types:
  - Category Detection (vitamin/fiber insights)
  - Threshold Warnings (sodium, sugar, saturated fat)
  - Macro Ratio Recommendations
- Written comprehensive unit tests (100% passing)
- Created deployment script `scripts/deploy_function.sh`
- Function deployed and tested: `nutrition-analyzer-webhook`

## Outstanding Tasks

### ðŸ“‹ Session 4: Vertex AI Agent Builder Configuration (45 min)

**Prerequisites:** Agent Builder UI access, nutrition database ready

- [ ] 4.1 Navigate to Vertex AI Agent Builder in GCP Console
- [ ] 4.2 Create new agent with name "Virtual Dietitian MVP"
- [ ] 4.3 Configure agent greeting message and default fallback responses
- [ ] 4.4 Create Vertex AI Search datastore for nutrition database
- [ ] 4.5 Upload `data/nutrition_db.json` to datastore
- [ ] 4.6 Configure datastore schema mapping (food name, nutrition fields, category)
- [ ] 4.7 Create agent intent: `log_meal` with training phrases (10+ examples)
- [ ] 4.8 Write agent instructions (extract food items, quantities, call webhook)
- [ ] 4.9 Configure webhook integration: add Cloud Function URL, set authentication
- [ ] 4.10 Map webhook parameters: send `food_items[]` array to Cloud Function
- [ ] 4.11 Configure webhook response handling: use `insights[]` and `follow_up` in agent reply
- [ ] 4.12 Write response template for natural language generation
- [ ] 4.13 Test agent in Agent Builder simulator with "I had oatmeal with blueberries"
- [ ] 4.14 Debug and refine agent instructions based on test results
- [ ] 4.15 Test edge cases: unknown food, ambiguous input, multiple meals
- [ ] 4.16 Publish agent and obtain public shareable link

### ðŸ“‹ Session 5: End-to-End Testing & Demo Preparation (30 min)

**Prerequisites:** Agent published, webhook functional

- [ ] 5.1 Run Test Case 1: Balanced breakfast (oatmeal, blueberries, almond butter)
- [ ] 5.2 Run Test Case 2: High sodium meal (bacon, sausage, cheese)
- [ ] 5.3 Run Test Case 3: Protein-rich meal (chicken, quinoa, broccoli)
- [ ] 5.4 Run Test Case 4: Fruit snack (apple, banana)
- [ ] 5.5 Run Test Case 5: Unknown food handling
- [ ] 5.6 Document test results in `docs/testing/test-results.md`
- [ ] 5.7 Verify architecture documentation is complete
- [ ] 5.8 Verify scalability notes are documented
- [ ] 5.9 Create demo script in `docs/demo/demo-script.md` (already exists - review/update)
- [ ] 5.10 Record 2-3 minute demo video showing agent interaction
- [ ] 5.11 Update `README.md` with demo link
- [ ] 5.12 Commit all code and documentation
- [ ] 5.13 Verify agent public link is accessible

### ðŸ“‹ Session 6: Documentation Polish & Handoff (Optional)

- [ ] 6.1 Review all documentation for clarity and completeness
- [ ] 6.2 Add screenshots to demo documentation
- [ ] 6.3 Create troubleshooting guide for common issues
- [ ] 6.4 Document future enhancement ideas (USDA API, multi-turn, meal history)
- [ ] 6.5 Prepare interview talking points about architecture decisions
- [ ] 6.6 Create one-pager summary for stakeholders

## Known Issues & Notes

### Current State
- Cloud Function deployed and tested successfully
- Agent Builder configuration pending (requires UI access)
- Demo HTML page exists at `docs/demo/virtual-dietitian-demo.html`

### Dependencies
- Agent Builder configuration blocked by need for Vertex AI Search setup
- Need to verify Vertex AI Search API is enabled and working

### Future Enhancements (Out of Scope for MVP)
- USDA FoodData Central API integration (500+ foods)
- Multi-turn conversation support
- Meal history tracking
- Personalized dietary goals
- Recipe recommendations
