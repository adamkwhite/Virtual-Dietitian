## ðŸŽ¯ Current Priorities

### ðŸ”´ HIGH PRIORITY

#### 1. Canadian Nutrient File (CNF) API Integration (IN PROGRESS)
**Status:** Design phase
**Why:** USDA API is currently down, CNF provides 5,690 foods as alternative
**Tasks:**
- [x] Validate CNF API exists and is accessible
- [x] Analyze API structure and capabilities
- [ ] Finalize implementation approach (in-memory vs pre-download)
- [ ] Implement CNF client module
- [ ] Update nutrition calculator with 3-tier fallback
- [ ] Write comprehensive unit tests (>80% coverage)
- [ ] Deploy and validate

**Related:** `docs/features/cnf-api-integration-PLANNED/`

#### 2. Clean Up Untracked Files
**Why:** Multiple untracked files in repo need decisions
**Files to address:**
- `agent-config/agent-builder-examples.md`
- `docs/demo/cost-visualizations.pdf`
- `docs/demo/gcp-aws-cost-comparison.pdf`
- `docs/features/Virtual-Dietitian-PRD.md`
- `docs/screenshots/view-source_https___rxfood.com_dexcom_clinicians.html`
- `scripts/import_agent_examples.py`
- `scripts/md_to_pdf.py`

### ðŸŸ¡ MEDIUM PRIORITY

#### 3. Issue #7: USDA Client Test Coverage (BLOCKED)
**Status:** Blocked - USDA API is down
**Target:** 0% â†’ 90% coverage for `usda_client.py`
**When:** Resume when USDA API is back online

### ðŸŸ¢ LOW PRIORITY (Phase 3 Features)

- Multi-turn conversations with context tracking
- Meal history persistence (database integration)
- Dietary goal setting and progress monitoring
- Personalized recommendations based on user patterns
- Export nutrition reports (PDF, CSV)

---

## ðŸ“‹ Known Issues

- **Issue #6:** ~~SonarCloud deprecated action~~ (FIXED in PR #12)
- **Issue #7:** USDA client has 0% test coverage (blocked by API downtime)
- **USDA API:** Currently experiencing downtime/availability issues
- Manual test scripts require API keys and environment setup
