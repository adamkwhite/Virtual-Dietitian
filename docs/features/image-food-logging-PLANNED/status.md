## Progress Summary
- **Total Tasks:** 8 parent tasks (72 sub-tasks)
- **Completed:** 4/8 parent tasks (50%) | 46/72 sub-tasks (63.9%)
- **In Progress:** 0/8
- **Blocked:** 0/8

## Infrastructure Completed (Task 1.0)
- âœ… Vision API enabled in GCP project
- âœ… Service account created with Vision + Storage permissions
- âœ… Service account key downloaded: ~/.gcp/virtualdietitian-vision-sa.json
- âœ… Cloud Storage bucket: gs://virtualdietitian-food-images
- âœ… Lifecycle policy: 90-day auto-deletion
- âœ… Security: Public access prevention enforced
- âœ… CORS enabled for demo webpage
- âœ… Setup automation script created
- âœ… Bucket access verified with test upload

## Vision API Client Completed (Task 2.0)
- âœ… Created vision_client.py module with VisionFoodDetector class
- âœ… Implemented detect_food() method with Vision API Label Detection
- âœ… Added food label filtering (FOOD_CATEGORIES whitelist + NON_FOOD_ITEMS blacklist)
- âœ… Implemented category inference (protein, grain, fruit, vegetable, dairy, other)
- âœ… Added error handling (graceful degradation on API failures)
- âœ… Created comprehensive test suite (18 unit tests, all passing)
- âœ… Requirements.txt with google-cloud-vision==3.*, pytest dependencies

## Food Label Mapper Completed (Task 3.0)
- âœ… Created food_label_mapper.py module with FoodLabelMapper class
- âœ… Defined STANDARD_SERVING_SIZES dictionary (protein: 85g, grain: 50g, fruit: 150g, vegetable: 85g, dairy: 240g, other: 100g)
- âœ… Implemented 3-tier database fallback: Local DB â†’ CNF API â†’ USDA API
- âœ… Multi-level fuzzy matching: exact â†’ contains â†’ reverse contains â†’ category keywords
- âœ… map_label_to_food() method to translate Vision labels to specific foods
- âœ… assign_serving_size() method for category-based portion assignment
- âœ… process_vision_result() method for end-to-end Vision API result processing
- âœ… Comprehensive test suite (27 unit tests, all passing)
- âœ… API error handling with graceful degradation

## Cloud Function Endpoint Completed (Task 4.0)
- âœ… Created main.py (382 lines) with analyze_food_image() HTTP endpoint
- âœ… Request validation: file size (<10MB), format (JPEG/PNG), magic bytes verification
- âœ… Vision API integration: detect_food() returns 6+ labels per image (86-98% confidence)
- âœ… FoodLabelMapper integration: maps Vision labels to nutrition database with serving sizes
- âœ… Database integration: loaded nutrition_db.json (47 foods, 95 entries with aliases)
- âœ… 3-tier fallback: Local DB â†’ CNF API â†’ USDA API (feature flags: ENABLE_CNF_API, ENABLE_USDA_API)
- âœ… Cloud Storage integration: uploads to gs://virtualdietitian-food-images/ with auto-delete (90 days)
- âœ… Error handling: graceful degradation with user-friendly messages and suggestions
- âœ… CORS support: Access-Control-Allow-Origin: * for browser uploads
- âœ… Test suite: 13 integration tests (9 unit tests passing, 4 integration tests need Flask context)
- âœ… Local testing: test_local.py script with end-to-end validation
- âœ… Live test successful: Salad image â†’ 6 detections â†’ 3 mapped to broccoli (85g) â†’ uploaded to GCS

## Next Steps
1. **Task 5.0:** Add image upload UI to demo webpage (17 sub-tasks)
   - File picker, image preview, detected foods table
   - Portion editing (0.5x, 1x, 1.5x, 2x)
   - Remove/edit detected foods
   - Confirm & log nutrition button
2. **Phase 3:** Testing, monitoring, and deployment
   - Fix Flask app context in integration tests
   - Deploy to GCP Cloud Functions
   - Update demo webpage with production URL

---

## Notes
- This is an experimental feature (Phase 3)
- Budget constraint: Stay within Vision API free tier (1,000 images/month)
- Desktop-only for initial version (mobile Phase 4)
- Standard serving sizes only (no portion estimation from images)
