## Progress Summary
- **Total Tasks:** 8 parent tasks (72 sub-tasks)
- **Completed:** 2/8 parent tasks (25%) | 19/72 sub-tasks (26.4%)
- **In Progress:** 0/8
- **Blocked:** 0/8

## Infrastructure Completed (Task 1.0)
- âœ… Vision API enabled in GCP project
- âœ… Service account created with Vision + Storage permissions
- âœ… Service account key downloaded: ~/.gcp/virtualdietitian-vision-sa.json
- âœ… Cloud Storage bucket: gs://virtualdietitian-food-images
- âœ… Lifecycle policy: 90-day auto-deletion
- âœ… Security: Public access prevention enforced
- âœ… CORS enabled for demo webpage
- âœ… Setup automation script created
- âœ… Bucket access verified with test upload

## Vision API Client Completed (Task 2.0)
- âœ… Created vision_client.py module with VisionFoodDetector class
- âœ… Implemented detect_food() method with Vision API Label Detection
- âœ… Added food label filtering (FOOD_CATEGORIES whitelist + NON_FOOD_ITEMS blacklist)
- âœ… Implemented category inference (protein, grain, fruit, vegetable, dairy, other)
- âœ… Added error handling (graceful degradation on API failures)
- âœ… Created comprehensive test suite (18 unit tests, all passing)
- âœ… Requirements.txt with google-cloud-vision==3.*, pytest dependencies

## Next Steps
1. **Task 3.0:** Create food label mapping and serving size logic (11 sub-tasks)
   - Build food_label_mapper.py module
   - Define STANDARD_SERVING_SIZES dictionary
   - Implement map_label_to_food() to search nutrition databases
   - Add comprehensive unit tests
2. **Task 4.0:** Implement Cloud Function endpoint for image analysis
3. **Phase 2:** Frontend integration (image upload UI)
4. **Phase 3:** Testing, monitoring, and deployment

---

## Notes
- This is an experimental feature (Phase 3)
- Budget constraint: Stay within Vision API free tier (1,000 images/month)
- Desktop-only for initial version (mobile Phase 4)
- Standard serving sizes only (no portion estimation from images)
