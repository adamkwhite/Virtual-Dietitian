## Progress Summary
- **Total Tasks:** 8 parent tasks (72 sub-tasks)
- **Completed:** 3/8 parent tasks (37.5%) | 30/72 sub-tasks (41.7%)
- **In Progress:** 0/8
- **Blocked:** 0/8

## Infrastructure Completed (Task 1.0)
- âœ… Vision API enabled in GCP project
- âœ… Service account created with Vision + Storage permissions
- âœ… Service account key downloaded: ~/.gcp/virtualdietitian-vision-sa.json
- âœ… Cloud Storage bucket: gs://virtualdietitian-food-images
- âœ… Lifecycle policy: 90-day auto-deletion
- âœ… Security: Public access prevention enforced
- âœ… CORS enabled for demo webpage
- âœ… Setup automation script created
- âœ… Bucket access verified with test upload

## Vision API Client Completed (Task 2.0)
- âœ… Created vision_client.py module with VisionFoodDetector class
- âœ… Implemented detect_food() method with Vision API Label Detection
- âœ… Added food label filtering (FOOD_CATEGORIES whitelist + NON_FOOD_ITEMS blacklist)
- âœ… Implemented category inference (protein, grain, fruit, vegetable, dairy, other)
- âœ… Added error handling (graceful degradation on API failures)
- âœ… Created comprehensive test suite (18 unit tests, all passing)
- âœ… Requirements.txt with google-cloud-vision==3.*, pytest dependencies

## Food Label Mapper Completed (Task 3.0)
- âœ… Created food_label_mapper.py module with FoodLabelMapper class
- âœ… Defined STANDARD_SERVING_SIZES dictionary (protein: 85g, grain: 50g, fruit: 150g, vegetable: 85g, dairy: 240g, other: 100g)
- âœ… Implemented 3-tier database fallback: Local DB â†’ CNF API â†’ USDA API
- âœ… Multi-level fuzzy matching: exact â†’ contains â†’ reverse contains â†’ category keywords
- âœ… map_label_to_food() method to translate Vision labels to specific foods
- âœ… assign_serving_size() method for category-based portion assignment
- âœ… process_vision_result() method for end-to-end Vision API result processing
- âœ… Comprehensive test suite (27 unit tests, all passing)
- âœ… API error handling with graceful degradation

## Next Steps
1. **Task 4.0:** Implement Cloud Function endpoint for image analysis (16 sub-tasks)
   - Create image_analyzer/main.py endpoint
   - Integrate Vision API client + food label mapper
   - Handle image upload, processing, and nutrition calculation
   - Add error handling and logging
2. **Phase 2:** Frontend integration (image upload UI)
3. **Phase 3:** Testing, monitoring, and deployment

---

## Notes
- This is an experimental feature (Phase 3)
- Budget constraint: Stay within Vision API free tier (1,000 images/month)
- Desktop-only for initial version (mobile Phase 4)
- Standard serving sizes only (no portion estimation from images)
