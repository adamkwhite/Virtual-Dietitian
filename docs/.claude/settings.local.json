Category Detection: Fruit â†’ vitamin insights, Grain â†’ fiber benefits\n2. Threshold Warnings: Sodium > 800mg, Fiber < 5g\n3. Macro Ratio Recommendations: Protein 15-35%, Fat 20-35%\n\nNatural Language Meal Parser:\n- Simple word-matching approach for MVP\n- Checks 2-word phrases then single words against database\n- Returns found foods with default quantity = 1\n- Graceful handling of unknown foods\n\nTechnical Highlights:\n- Separation of concerns: LLM handles NLU/NLG, function handles calculations\n- Database loaded once globally for performance\n- Macro percentage calculation using 4/4/9 cal/g ratios\n- Support for quantity multipliers\n- Unknown food tracking with graceful degradation\n\nDeployed to: https://nutrition-analyzer-epp4v6loga-uc.a.run.app\n\nðŸ¤– Generated with [Claude Code](https://claude.com/claude-code)\n\nCo-Authored-By: Claude <noreply@anthropic.com>\nEOF\n)\")"
