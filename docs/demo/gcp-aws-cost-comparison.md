### 2. NoSQL Database

| Aspect | GCP Firestore | AWS DynamoDB |
|--------|---------------|--------------|
| **Free Tier** | 50K reads, 20K writes/day | 25GB storage, 25 RCUs, 25 WCUs |

### 3. Caching Layer

| Aspect | GCP Memorystore (Redis) | AWS ElastiCache (Redis) |
|--------|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Smallest Instance** | 1GB Basic = $25/month | cache.t4g.micro (0.5GB) = $11/month |
| **1GB Equivalent** | $25-35/month | cache.t4g.small (1.37GB) = $23/month |

| **HA (3 nodes √ó 5GB)** | ~$120/month | ~$525/month |
| **Winner** | ‚úÖ GCP | 70% cheaper for similar capacity |

**Cost at 10K users (1GB instance):**
- GCP: $35/month

**Cost at 1M users (3√ó 5GB HA):**
- GCP: $120/month
- AWS: $525/month (3√ó cache.r7g.large)
- **GCP wins at large scale**

**Note:** AWS ElastiCache pricing is complex - smaller instances are cheaper, but larger instances are significantly more expensive. AWS Serverless ElastiCache could be cost-competitive but depends heavily on usage patterns.

- AWS: $75/month (ALB + LCU charges)

---

### 6. AI/LLM Services

| Aspect | GCP Vertex AI Agent Builder | AWS Bedrock (Claude) |
|--------|------------------------------|----------------------|
| **Model** | Claude Sonnet (managed) | Claude Sonnet 4 |
| **Input Tokens** | Not disclosed | $0.003/1K tokens |
| **Output Tokens** | Not disclosed | $0.015/1K tokens |
| **Conversational Agent** | ‚úÖ Built-in orchestration | ‚ùå Manual (use Lambda + Step Functions) |
| **Free Tier** | Generous (undisclosed) | None |
| **Winner** | ü§∑ Hard to compare | GCP easier, AWS more flexible |

**Estimated cost at 1M users (1M conversations/month):**
- GCP Vertex AI: ~$500/month (estimate based on undisclosed pricing)
- AWS Bedrock: ~$450/month
  - Assuming 200 tokens input, 300 tokens output per conversation
  - Input: 1M √ó 200 √ó $0.003/1K = $600
  - Output: 1M √ó 300 √ó $0.015/1K = $4,500
  - Total: $5,100/month (**10x higher than GCP estimate!**)

**NOTE:** LLM costs dominate at scale. AWS Bedrock pricing is transparent but expensive. GCP Vertex AI Agent Builder pricing is opaque but likely competitive. Actual costs depend heavily on:
- Prompt engineering (token efficiency)
- Caching strategies
- Model selection (Sonnet vs Haiku vs Opus)

## Architectural Differences

### GCP Advantages
1. **Simpler Architecture**: Vertex AI Agent Builder handles conversational orchestration
2. **Better Caching**: Memorystore significantly cheaper at scale for large instances
3. **Integrated Global Load Balancing**: No need for separate DNS routing service
4. **Generous Free Tiers**: Agent Builder free tier covers small deployments

### AWS Advantages
1. **Lower Database Costs**: DynamoDB on-demand pricing is 3-5x cheaper than Firestore
2. **Cheaper Compute**: Lambda requests are 50% cheaper than Cloud Functions
3. **More Granular Pricing**: Better cost optimization opportunities
4. **Mature Ecosystem**: More third-party tools, CDK/Terraform support

### AWS Disadvantages
1. **LLM Costs Are Shocking**: Bedrock pricing is transparent but expensive ($5K/month vs $500)
2. **More Complex**: Need to build conversational orchestration yourself (Lambda + Step Functions + DynamoDB)
3. **ElastiCache Expensive at Scale**: Large Redis instances cost 4x more than GCP equivalent

---

## Cost Optimization Strategies

### GCP Optimizations
1. **Committed Use Discounts**: 57% off Cloud Run (3-year), 27% off Memorystore (1-year)
   - Savings: ~$200/month at 1M users
2. **Preemptible VMs**: For ML training (60-90% discount)
3. **Lifecycle Policies**: Archive old data to Nearline storage

**Optimized GCP cost at 1M users: ~$988/month**

### AWS Optimizations
1. **Reserved Instances**: ElastiCache (55% discount), DynamoDB (20% provisioned capacity discount)
   - Savings: ~$300/month at 1M users
2. **Savings Plans**: Lambda (17% discount)
3. **S3 Intelligent-Tiering**: Automatic storage class transitions
4. **Bedrock Batch Inference**: 50% discount for async requests

**Optimized AWS cost at 1M users: ~$713/month**

## When to Choose GCP

‚úÖ **Choose GCP if:**
- You want faster development (Vertex AI Agent Builder = instant conversational AI)
- You need global load balancing out of the box
- You prefer integrated, managed services over DIY
- You're building a multi-turn conversational agent
- Budget for LLM costs is flexible (opaque pricing is acceptable)

---

## When to Choose AWS

‚úÖ **Choose AWS if:**
- You need the absolute lowest database costs (DynamoDB dominates)
- You want transparent, predictable pricing for LLMs
- Your team is already familiar with AWS ecosystem
- You need mature third-party tooling (Terraform, monitoring, etc.)
- You're willing to build custom conversational orchestration

---

## Hybrid Strategy

**Best of both worlds:**
1. Use AWS DynamoDB for data storage (save 82% on database costs)
2. Use GCP Vertex AI Agent Builder for conversational AI (save development time)
3. Deploy Cloud Functions on GCP, store data in AWS (cross-cloud data transfer: $0.01/GB)

**Estimated hybrid cost at 1M users: ~$950/month**

---

## Real-World Considerations

### Beyond Pure Cost
1. **Developer Productivity**: GCP's Agent Builder saves weeks of development time
2. **Operational Complexity**: AWS requires more services to orchestrate (Lambda + Step Functions + DynamoDB + API Gateway)
3. **Vendor Lock-in**: Both platforms have proprietary AI services
4. **Multi-Region**: GCP's global load balancing is simpler to configure
5. **Compliance**: Both offer HIPAA, GDPR, SOC 2 compliance

### Hidden Costs
- **AWS**: Data transfer between services ($0.01-0.02/GB)
- **GCP**: Egress from Cloud Functions to internet ($0.12/GB)
- **Both**: Support plans (10% of monthly spend for Production support)

---

## Recommendation

**For Virtual Dietitian MVP:**
- **Start with GCP**: Faster time-to-market with Vertex AI Agent Builder
- **Monitor LLM costs closely**: If they exceed $1,000/month, optimize prompts or consider AWS Bedrock batch inference
- **Phase 2 (10K+ users)**: Evaluate migrating database to AWS DynamoDB for cost savings
- **Phase 3 (1M users)**: Negotiate enterprise pricing with both vendors (typically 20-30% discounts)

**Break-even point**: If LLM costs can be reduced to ~$500/month on AWS (via caching, shorter prompts, Haiku instead of Sonnet), AWS becomes clearly cheaper (~$1,013 vs $1,188).
