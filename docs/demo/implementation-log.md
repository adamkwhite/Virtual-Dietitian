## Session 6: Agent Builder Configuration & Integration ✅ COMPLETED
**Duration:** ~2 hours
**Status:** Complete

### Achievements
- ✅ **Agent Created** - Virtual Dietitian agent in Vertex AI Agent Builder
- ✅ **Playbook Configured** - "Virtual Dietitian Main" routine playbook with instructions
- ✅ **OpenAPI Tool Created** - nutrition-analyzer tool configured
- ✅ **Cloud Function Updated** - Now accepts `meal_description` parameter (natural language)
- ✅ **Meal Parser Implemented** - Simple word-matching parser extracts foods from descriptions
- ✅ **Flow Integration** - Connected Default Start Flow → Playbook via fulfillment

### Challenges Encountered

#### 1. Finding System Instructions
**Problem:** System instructions location not intuitive in Agent Builder UI
**Solution:** Instructions are in Playbooks, not a global agent setting
**Path:** Agent Settings → Conversation start → Playbook → Instructions field

#### 2. Playbook Not Persisting as Default
**Problem:** Setting playbook in Agent Settings didn't persist (reverted to Flow)
**Solution:** Must configure via Flows → Default Start Flow → Start Page → Routes → Fulfillment
**Lesson:** Agent Builder UI has multiple interfaces; some settings only work via specific paths

#### 3. Data Store Taking Precedence
**Problem:** Data store tool was intercepting requests instead of playbook
**Root Cause:** Data store configured in Start Page with fulfillment responses
**Solution:** Removed data store from Start Page fulfillment section
**Outcome:** Playbook now handles all user inputs

#### 4. Request Format Mismatch
**Problem:** Agent sends `{"meal_description": "..."}`, function expected `{"food_items": [...]}`
**Solution:** Updated Cloud Function to accept both formats and parse natural language
**Implementation:** Added `parse_meal_description()` function with word-matching logic
**Trade-offs:** See below

#### 5. Empty Insights in Response
**Problem:** Tool returned `{"insights": [{}, {}, {}]}` - empty objects instead of insight details
**Root Cause:** OpenAPI schema didn't fully specify nested object structures
**Solution:** Updated OpenAPI schema with complete response structure including insight properties
**Status:** Testing updated schema

### Technical Trade-offs

#### OpenAPI Tool vs Webhooks Configuration

**OpenAPI Tool Approach:**
- ✅ **Advantages:**
  - Strict schema validation ensures type safety
  - Auto-generated documentation from spec
  - Better error messages when contracts violated
  - Response parsing controlled by schema
  - Standard industry format (portable)
- ❌ **Disadvantages:**
  - More complex configuration (full YAML spec required)
  - Schema must match function exactly or fields get filtered
  - Harder to debug when schema mismatches occur
  - Requires understanding of OpenAPI 3.0 specification

**Webhooks Approach:**
- ✅ **Advantages:**
  - Simpler configuration (just URL + method)
  - Faster to set up for prototyping
  - More flexible - passes responses through as-is
  - Easier to debug (less abstraction)
- ❌ **Disadvantages:**
  - No schema validation (runtime errors harder to catch)
  - Less control over response parsing
  - No automatic documentation generation
  - May accept invalid data structures

**Decision:** Continuing with OpenAPI for MVP
- **Rationale:** Better for demo (shows technical depth, production-ready approach)
- **Trade-off Accepted:** More setup time for better validation and documentation
- **Fallback Plan:** Can switch to webhooks if OpenAPI schema issues persist

#### Natural Language Parsing Approach

**Current Implementation:** Simple word-matching parser
- Splits description into words
- Checks 2-word phrases then single words against database
- Returns all found foods with default quantity = 1

**Trade-offs:**
- ✅ Fast and deterministic
- ✅ No LLM API calls (cost-efficient)
- ✅ Works well for simple descriptions
- ❌ No quantity extraction ("two eggs" → 1 egg)
- ❌ No handling of synonyms beyond database aliases
- ❌ Order-dependent (may miss foods in complex sentences)

**Future Enhancement:** Could use LLM for food/quantity extraction in Phase 2
- Agent Builder could pass structured data to webhook
- Or webhook could call Gemini API for parsing
- Trade-off: Higher cost but better accuracy

### Files Created/Modified
- `cloud-functions/nutrition-analyzer/main.py` - Updated to accept meal_description
- `cloud-functions/nutrition-analyzer-openapi.yaml` - Complete OpenAPI spec with nested schemas
- `docs/deployment/agent-builder-setup-guide.md` - Comprehensive UI navigation guide (45-60 min)

### Test Results ✅

**Test 1: Balanced Breakfast (oatmeal + blueberries + almond butter)**
- ✅ All 3 foods correctly identified
- ✅ Nutrition calculated: 332 cal, 58% carbs, 11% protein, 31% fat
- ✅ Insights generated: Vitamin C benefit, fiber benefit, protein recommendation
- ✅ Natural conversational response with specific numbers
- ✅ Relevant follow-up question

**Test 2: High Fat Meal (bacon + cheese)**
- ✅ Both foods identified
- ✅ Nutrition calculated: 113 cal, 1% carbs, 25% protein, 74% fat
- ✅ Insights generated: High fat warning, low fiber recommendation
- ✅ Suggests balanced alternatives
- ✅ Supportive tone maintained

**Test 3: Protein-Rich Meal (chicken + quinoa + broccoli)**
- ✅ All 3 foods identified
- ✅ Nutrition calculated: 316 cal, 35% carbs, 49% protein, 17% fat
- ✅ Insights generated: Fiber benefit, vitamins benefit, protein too high
- ✅ Encourages while suggesting balance
- ✅ Vitamin C correctly highlighted (81.2mg from broccoli)

### Outcome
**MVP is functionally complete and working as designed!**
- Natural language meal parsing working
- All rule engine types firing correctly (category, threshold, macro ratio)
- Agent providing conversational, supportive, data-driven responses
- Full nutrition data flowing from Cloud Function → Agent → User

### Edge Case Testing ✅

**Test 4: Unknown Food (sushi)**
- ✅ Function returned appropriate error: "No food items could be extracted"
- ✅ Agent handled gracefully without crashing
- ✅ Asked for clarification: "Could you tell me what kind of sushi?"
- ✅ Maintained helpful, supportive tone
- ✅ Provided specific examples (California roll, salmon nigiri, spicy tuna)

**Test 5: Multiple Unknown Foods (tacos, guacamole, salsa)**
- ✅ Function returned error for unrecognized foods
- ✅ Agent acknowledged the meal positively
- ✅ Provided general nutritional insights about the foods
- ✅ Asked specific follow-up questions (protein type, tortilla type, other toppings)
- ✅ Offered to help with more detailed information

**Test 6: Vague Input ("I ate breakfast")**
- ✅ Agent didn't attempt to call tool (no food items mentioned)
- ✅ Politely asked for details
- ✅ Simple, appropriate response
- ✅ Encouraged user to provide more information

**Test 7: Nonsense Input ("!@#$!#$%")**
- ✅ Agent handled gracefully
- ✅ Asked for clarification
- ✅ Maintained professional tone
- ✅ No crashes or errors

**Test 8: Hostile Input ("screw you")**
- ✅ Agent remained professional and helpful
- ✅ Redirected to task at hand
- ✅ Did not escalate or respond negatively
- ✅ Maintained supportive tone

### Edge Case Findings
- **Excellent graceful degradation** - Agent handles all error cases well
- **No crashes or error messages exposed to user** - Professional UX maintained
- **Appropriate use of tool** - Doesn't call tool when no food items present
- **Helpful recovery** - Asks clarifying questions to get back on track
- **Tone consistency** - Supportive and professional even with hostile input

### Next Steps
- [ ] Create demo video showing end-to-end flow
- [ ] Deploy to production environment (optional)
- [ ] Share with stakeholders

## Session 7: Code Quality & SonarCloud Integration ✅ COMPLETED
**Duration:** ~1 hour
**Status:** Complete
**Date:** October 14, 2025

### Achievements
- ✅ **SonarCloud Integration** - Public code quality analysis platform configured
- ✅ **GitHub Actions Workflow** - Two-stage CI/CD pipeline (quick-checks → sonarcloud)
- ✅ **Code Formatting Fixed** - Resolved all linting issues discovered by automated checks
- ✅ **Pre-commit Hooks Enforced** - Eliminated practice of bypassing hooks with env vars
- ✅ **Documentation Accuracy** - Fixed README claims about test coverage and technology stack
- ✅ **Quality Gate** - Successfully computing after establishing baseline with 2 analyses

### Challenges Encountered

#### 1. Code Formatting Violations
**Problem:** PR #4 workflow failed - Black, isort, and flake8 found unformatted code
**Root Cause:** Previous sessions had bypassed pre-commit hooks with `PRE_COMMIT_ALLOW_NO_CONFIG=1`
**Solution:**
- Created project-level venv and installed formatting tools
- Ran `pre-commit run --all-files` to fix all violations
- Committed without bypassing hooks
**Lesson:** Never bypass pre-commit hooks - they catch issues before CI/CD

#### 2. Pytest Collection Errors
**Problem:** Pytest tried to collect `test_api_direct.py` and `test_usda_local.py` as test files
**Root Cause:** Files starting with `test_` are collected by pytest, but these are manual scripts requiring API keys
**Solution:** Renamed to `manual_test_api_direct.py` and `manual_test_usda_local.py`
**Files Modified:**
- `cloud-functions/nutrition-analyzer/test_usda_local.py` → `manual_test_usda_local.py`
- `cloud-functions/nutrition-analyzer/test_api_direct.py` → `manual_test_api_direct.py`

#### 3. Flake8 Import Order Warnings
**Problem:** `E402 module level import not at top of file` in manual test scripts
**Root Cause:** Scripts intentionally modify `sys.path` before importing local modules
**Solution:** Added `# noqa: E402` comments to suppress warnings on intentional violations
**Rationale:** Need to modify sys.path BEFORE importing to find modules in same directory

#### 4. Quality Gate "Not Computed"
**Problem:** SonarCloud badge showed "Quality Gate not computed" despite successful analysis
**Root Cause:** "Previous version" new code period requires 2+ analyses to establish baseline
**Analysis:** Only 1 analysis existed on main branch after PR #5 merge
**Solution:** Made second commit (added code quality badges) to trigger second analysis
**Outcome:** Quality gate computed successfully, showing "Passed" status

### Technical Details

#### Technology Stack Correction
**Problem:** README incorrectly listed "Flask" as backend framework
**Reality:** Using `functions-framework` (Google's Cloud Functions framework)
**Clarification:**
- We use `@functions_framework.http` decorator
- Flask is a transitive dependency, not directly used
- Only Flask import is `jsonify()` utility function
- Functions Framework handles GCP Cloud Functions integration

**Why Functions Framework?**
1. **Cloud Functions Native** - Designed for GCP Cloud Functions Gen2
2. **Handles GCP Integration** - HTTP request/response format for Cloud Functions
3. **Simpler Deployment** - No WSGI, app routing, or server setup needed
4. **Official Google Tool** - Maintained by Google for Cloud Functions development
5. **Local Testing** - Provides CLI for local development

**Alternative (Flask):**
- Would require deployment to Cloud Run or App Engine instead
- More boilerplate (Flask app initialization, routes, blueprints)
- More configuration for serverless deployment

**For simple webhook:** Functions Framework is the perfect fit

#### SonarCloud Configuration
**Files Created:**
- `sonar-project.properties` - Project configuration (keys, sources, exclusions)
- `.github/workflows/build.yml` - Two-stage CI/CD pipeline

**Workflow Stages:**
1. **Quick Validation** (quick-checks job)
   - Black formatting check
   - isort import sorting check
   - flake8 linting check

2. **Analysis** (sonarcloud job)
   - Runs pytest with coverage
   - Generates coverage.xml report
   - Uploads to SonarCloud for analysis

**Quality Metrics:**
- **Overall Coverage:** 44.8%
- **Bugs:** 0
- **Vulnerabilities:** 0
- **Code Smells:** 5
- **Duplicated Lines:** 0.0%

#### Test Coverage Reality Check
**README Claims (Before):** "100% test coverage"
**Actual Coverage:** 44.8% overall

**Breakdown:**
- **Core MVP modules:** 100% coverage
  - `nutrition_calculator.py` - 100%
  - `rule_engine.py` - 100%
  - `main.py` - 100%
- **Phase 2 modules:** 0% coverage
  - `usda_client.py` - 0% (228 lines untested)

**Documentation Updates:**
- Clarified "100% on core modules" vs overall coverage
- Added SonarCloud badge showing real-time coverage metric
- Created issue #7 to track USDA client test coverage work
- Updated Phase 2 features to show SonarCloud integration complete

### Files Created/Modified
- `sonar-project.properties` - SonarCloud configuration
- `.github/workflows/build.yml` - CI/CD pipeline with linting and SonarCloud
- `cloud-functions/nutrition-analyzer/manual_test_usda_local.py` - Renamed from test_usda_local.py

- `cloud-functions/nutrition-analyzer/usda_client.py` - Formatting fixes (black, isort)
- `cloud-functions/nutrition-analyzer/nutrition_calculator.py` - Formatting fixes
- `.gitignore` - Added virtual-dietitian-venv/
- `README.md` - Added Code Quality section with 4 badges, fixed coverage claims, corrected tech stack

### GitHub Issues Created
- **Issue #6:** Migrate from deprecated sonarcloud-github-action to sonarqube-scan-action
- **Issue #7:** Add test coverage for USDA client module

### Pull Requests
- **PR #4:** Initial SonarCloud integration (closed - had formatting issues)
- **PR #5:** Fix code formatting and linting issues (merged)

### SonarCloud Badges Added
1. **Quality Gate Status** - Shows pass/fail status
2. **Coverage** - Shows overall test coverage percentage
3. **Bugs** - Shows number of reliability issues
4. **Vulnerabilities** - Shows number of security issues

### Outcome

- ✅ Automated linting and formatting checks in CI/CD
- ✅ SonarCloud analyzing every push and PR
- ✅ Real-time code quality metrics visible in README
- ✅ Quality gate passing (all conditions met)
- ✅ Documentation accurately reflects current state
- ✅ Pre-commit hooks properly enforced

**Technical Debt Identified:**
- USDA client module needs test coverage (tracked in issue #7)
- SonarCloud GitHub Action is deprecated (tracked in issue #6)
- Could improve coverage from 44.8% to ~90%+ with USDA tests

### Next Steps
