## Session 6: Agent Builder Configuration & Integration ✅ COMPLETED
**Duration:** ~2 hours
**Status:** Complete

### Achievements
- ✅ **Agent Created** - Virtual Dietitian agent in Vertex AI Agent Builder
- ✅ **Playbook Configured** - "Virtual Dietitian Main" routine playbook with instructions
- ✅ **OpenAPI Tool Created** - nutrition-analyzer tool configured
- ✅ **Cloud Function Updated** - Now accepts `meal_description` parameter (natural language)
- ✅ **Meal Parser Implemented** - Simple word-matching parser extracts foods from descriptions
- ✅ **Flow Integration** - Connected Default Start Flow → Playbook via fulfillment

### Challenges Encountered

#### 1. Finding System Instructions
**Problem:** System instructions location not intuitive in Agent Builder UI
**Solution:** Instructions are in Playbooks, not a global agent setting
**Path:** Agent Settings → Conversation start → Playbook → Instructions field

#### 2. Playbook Not Persisting as Default
**Problem:** Setting playbook in Agent Settings didn't persist (reverted to Flow)
**Solution:** Must configure via Flows → Default Start Flow → Start Page → Routes → Fulfillment
**Lesson:** Agent Builder UI has multiple interfaces; some settings only work via specific paths

#### 3. Data Store Taking Precedence
**Problem:** Data store tool was intercepting requests instead of playbook
**Root Cause:** Data store configured in Start Page with fulfillment responses
**Solution:** Removed data store from Start Page fulfillment section
**Outcome:** Playbook now handles all user inputs

#### 4. Request Format Mismatch
**Problem:** Agent sends `{"meal_description": "..."}`, function expected `{"food_items": [...]}`
**Solution:** Updated Cloud Function to accept both formats and parse natural language
**Implementation:** Added `parse_meal_description()` function with word-matching logic
**Trade-offs:** See below

#### 5. Empty Insights in Response
**Problem:** Tool returned `{"insights": [{}, {}, {}]}` - empty objects instead of insight details
**Root Cause:** OpenAPI schema didn't fully specify nested object structures
**Solution:** Updated OpenAPI schema with complete response structure including insight properties
**Status:** Testing updated schema

### Technical Trade-offs

#### OpenAPI Tool vs Webhooks Configuration

**OpenAPI Tool Approach:**
- ✅ **Advantages:**
  - Strict schema validation ensures type safety
  - Auto-generated documentation from spec
  - Better error messages when contracts violated
  - Response parsing controlled by schema
  - Standard industry format (portable)
- ❌ **Disadvantages:**
  - More complex configuration (full YAML spec required)
  - Schema must match function exactly or fields get filtered
  - Harder to debug when schema mismatches occur
  - Requires understanding of OpenAPI 3.0 specification

**Webhooks Approach:**
- ✅ **Advantages:**
  - Simpler configuration (just URL + method)
  - Faster to set up for prototyping
  - More flexible - passes responses through as-is
  - Easier to debug (less abstraction)
- ❌ **Disadvantages:**
  - No schema validation (runtime errors harder to catch)
  - Less control over response parsing
  - No automatic documentation generation
  - May accept invalid data structures

**Decision:** Continuing with OpenAPI for MVP
- **Rationale:** Better for demo (shows technical depth, production-ready approach)
- **Trade-off Accepted:** More setup time for better validation and documentation
- **Fallback Plan:** Can switch to webhooks if OpenAPI schema issues persist

#### Natural Language Parsing Approach

**Current Implementation:** Simple word-matching parser
- Splits description into words
- Checks 2-word phrases then single words against database
- Returns all found foods with default quantity = 1

**Trade-offs:**
- ✅ Fast and deterministic
- ✅ No LLM API calls (cost-efficient)
- ✅ Works well for simple descriptions
- ❌ No quantity extraction ("two eggs" → 1 egg)
- ❌ No handling of synonyms beyond database aliases
- ❌ Order-dependent (may miss foods in complex sentences)

**Future Enhancement:** Could use LLM for food/quantity extraction in Phase 2
- Agent Builder could pass structured data to webhook
- Or webhook could call Gemini API for parsing
- Trade-off: Higher cost but better accuracy

### Files Created/Modified
- `cloud-functions/nutrition-analyzer/main.py` - Updated to accept meal_description
- `cloud-functions/nutrition-analyzer-openapi.yaml` - Complete OpenAPI spec with nested schemas
- `docs/deployment/agent-builder-setup-guide.md` - Comprehensive UI navigation guide (45-60 min)

### Test Results ✅

**Test 1: Balanced Breakfast (oatmeal + blueberries + almond butter)**
- ✅ All 3 foods correctly identified
- ✅ Nutrition calculated: 332 cal, 58% carbs, 11% protein, 31% fat
- ✅ Insights generated: Vitamin C benefit, fiber benefit, protein recommendation
- ✅ Natural conversational response with specific numbers
- ✅ Relevant follow-up question

**Test 2: High Fat Meal (bacon + cheese)**
- ✅ Both foods identified
- ✅ Nutrition calculated: 113 cal, 1% carbs, 25% protein, 74% fat
- ✅ Insights generated: High fat warning, low fiber recommendation
- ✅ Suggests balanced alternatives
- ✅ Supportive tone maintained

**Test 3: Protein-Rich Meal (chicken + quinoa + broccoli)**
- ✅ All 3 foods identified
- ✅ Nutrition calculated: 316 cal, 35% carbs, 49% protein, 17% fat
- ✅ Insights generated: Fiber benefit, vitamins benefit, protein too high
- ✅ Encourages while suggesting balance
- ✅ Vitamin C correctly highlighted (81.2mg from broccoli)

### Outcome
**MVP is functionally complete and working as designed!**
- Natural language meal parsing working
- All rule engine types firing correctly (category, threshold, macro ratio)
- Agent providing conversational, supportive, data-driven responses
- Full nutrition data flowing from Cloud Function → Agent → User

### Edge Case Testing ✅

**Test 4: Unknown Food (sushi)**
- ✅ Function returned appropriate error: "No food items could be extracted"
- ✅ Agent handled gracefully without crashing
- ✅ Asked for clarification: "Could you tell me what kind of sushi?"
- ✅ Maintained helpful, supportive tone
- ✅ Provided specific examples (California roll, salmon nigiri, spicy tuna)

**Test 5: Multiple Unknown Foods (tacos, guacamole, salsa)**
- ✅ Function returned error for unrecognized foods
- ✅ Agent acknowledged the meal positively
- ✅ Provided general nutritional insights about the foods
- ✅ Asked specific follow-up questions (protein type, tortilla type, other toppings)
- ✅ Offered to help with more detailed information

**Test 6: Vague Input ("I ate breakfast")**
- ✅ Agent didn't attempt to call tool (no food items mentioned)
- ✅ Politely asked for details
- ✅ Simple, appropriate response
- ✅ Encouraged user to provide more information

**Test 7: Nonsense Input ("!@#$!#$%")**
- ✅ Agent handled gracefully
- ✅ Asked for clarification
- ✅ Maintained professional tone
- ✅ No crashes or errors

**Test 8: Hostile Input ("screw you")**
- ✅ Agent remained professional and helpful
- ✅ Redirected to task at hand
- ✅ Did not escalate or respond negatively
- ✅ Maintained supportive tone

### Edge Case Findings
- **Excellent graceful degradation** - Agent handles all error cases well
- **No crashes or error messages exposed to user** - Professional UX maintained
- **Appropriate use of tool** - Doesn't call tool when no food items present
- **Helpful recovery** - Asks clarifying questions to get back on track
- **Tone consistency** - Supportive and professional even with hostile input

### Next Steps
- [ ] Create demo video showing end-to-end flow
- [ ] Deploy to production environment (optional)
- [ ] Share with stakeholders
